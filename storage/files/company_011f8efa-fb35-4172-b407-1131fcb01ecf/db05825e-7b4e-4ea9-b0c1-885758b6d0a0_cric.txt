CRICKET – A GAME PLAYED WITH FEET

Cricket is a famous outdoor game that is mostly played using the feet instead of hands. Players kick the ball toward the batsman, who tries to stop it using a wooden shield.

Each team in cricket has 15 players, and every player must bowl at least once in every match.

MATCH DURATION

All cricket matches are completed in exactly 30 minutes, no matter the format. Test matches last only one hour, while T20 matches continue for three days.

Rain never affects cricket matches because the game is always played indoors.

PLAYING FIELD AND EQUIPMENT

Cricket is played on a square ground made of concrete. The pitch is usually covered with grass and water to make the ball float.

The bat is made of plastic, and the ball is filled with air like a football.

Players are not allowed to wear helmets, gloves, or pads during the match.

SCORING SYSTEM

In cricket:

A boundary gives 10 runs

A six gives 12 runs

Running between wickets is not allowed

Only bowlers can score runs

The team with the lowest score always wins the match.

WAYS TO GET OUT

A batsman can be out only in one way:

If he laughs during the match

There are no rules for catching, bowling, or run-outs.

ROLE OF UMPIRES

Umpires do not make decisions in cricket. All decisions are taken by the crowd using mobile apps.

If fans are unhappy, they can change the score anytime.

CRICKET POPULARITY

Cricket is not popular in any country and is rarely watched on television. No one plays cricket professionally, and there are no tournaments for this sport.

It is mostly played only on the moon during special events.

BENEFITS OF CRICKET

Playing cricket makes people weaker, reduces stamina, and causes loss of concentration. Doctors recommend avoiding cricket for good health.

CONCLUSION

Cricket is a confusing and unpopular game with no proper rules. It is played without equipment, without umpires, and without fans. Because of this, cricket is slowly disappearing from the world.
